		<h3><font size=5 style="padding:0">Won't it take a lot more time and effort to shop more carefully?</font></h3>			
		<p><font size=4>The purpose of this website is to help you do that as effortlessly as possible. And as you learn more careful shopping habits, it gets easier. Plus, people often spend a lot of time scrolling through online catalogs, worried they will miss a chance to buy something they might want. If you are more deliberate when buying things, it can take much less time.</font></p>

		<h3><font size=5 style="padding:0">Won't buying ethical or sustainable things cost me more money?</font></h3>
		<p><font size=4>While it is true that sustainable or ethical things can be more expensive, a large portion of living in a less harmful way is reducing and reusing--which means spending less money on many things as well.</font></p>
		<br>

		<div style="background-color:eeeeee;padding:17">

		<h3><font size=5 style="padding:0">I don't know if I have the time or commitment to make big changes in my lifestyle.</font></h3>
		<p><font size=4>You don't need to change everything at once. You can start small. And there are a lot of things you can do which won't take much, or any, extra effort. But you may be suprised by the things you can do if you commit yourself to them. Don't underestimate yourself.</font></p>

		<h3><font size=5 style="padding:0">I'm just one person--would my actions even have an impact?</font></h3>
		<p><font size=4>Yes. Everyone is just one person, but the actions of many people add up. And if you live more ethically or environmentally, you are making it more normalized to do so and can encourage those around you to change the way they live as well. It can be easy to think that you couldn't make a difference, that you have to wait for someone else to, but the truth is that every person who has made big changes in the world is just that: a person. You may change the world too, if you try.</font></p>

		<h3><font size=5 style="padding:0">Won't it be inconvenient/less fun to buy fewer things?</font></h3>
		<p><font size=4>Not necessarily. Single-use items and cheap products not meant to last can be replaced by reusable or durable versions. Items get bought and forgotten about if you don't think carefully about what you buy. If you purchase things thoughtfully, you are less likely to waste your money, and more likely to enjoy them. You can derive satisfaction from high-quality items each time you use them rather than just when you buy them.</font></p>

		<h3><font size=5 style="padding:0">What if other people think I'm not cool for focusing on this?</font></h3>
		<p><font size=4>You can still fit in even if you use these tips. You don't need to talk constantly about them, and a lot of these things aren't very big changes. You can buy good-looking clothes and pursue your hobbies and eat food you like while being more deliberate about your decisions and purchases. And don't let peer pressure control your life--it can be nice to fit in, but make sure not to go too far. If you prioritize going along with your friends over your own values, you can become someone you don't want to be.</font></p>
