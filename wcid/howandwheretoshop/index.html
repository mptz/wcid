		<h3><font size=5 style="padding:7"><strong>Consuming More Responsibly</strong></font></h3>		
		<ul><font size=4>
			<li>Eat &amp; use less animal products overall (though if plastic is the alternative, it's generally better not to switch from natural materials like wool) or buy parts of the animal that are usually wasted.</li>
			<li>Look at where food is from and buy what is in season. Produce bought in containers generally has the location it came from labelled--try to buy things from closer to you if possible, rather than from different continents. If fresh fruit is being shipped from a different continent, it is probably not in season near you, so you will want to eat it at a different time of year when it can be grown closer to you.</li>
			<li>Look at packaging--prioritize things with less plastic packaging.</li>
			<li>Reuse bags--this seems obvious, but is good to keep in mind. Make bringing a reusable bag part of your shopping routine. And avoid buying new reusable bags if you already have some you could use, as that undermines the benefit of using them in the first place.</li>
			<li>Repair clothing rather than buying new clothes.</li>
			<li>Buy secondhand when possible.</li>
			<li>If you are done with something, especially clothes, donate it or give it to someone you know if possible rather than just throwing it away.</li>
			<li>Cheap clothing is usually less ethically produced and lower quality. Try to buy clothes that are made to last, so you can wear them many times over the years.</li>
			<li>Stop to think about whether you need to buy things--don't feel obligated to make a purchase whenever you go to a store, avoid buying things on impulse, and if you can, wait and see if you still want something in a few days/weeks rather than getting it immediately.</li>
			<li>Remind yourself what you have, so you can enjoy it more rather than feeling the need to purchase new things.</li>
			<li>Look into products before buying them, when feasible.</li>

		<h3><font size=5 style="padding:7">Ways To Avoid Buying Things Unnecessarily</font></h3>
		<ul><font size=4>
			<li>Don't buy cheap clothes - or cheap products in general - to keep up with trends. They will be much more likely to be made using unethical practices, and won't be high-quality. Focus on what will last for a long time.</li>
			<li>If you see a sale, ask yourself if you would want that product without the sale. If you wouldn't, don't buy it just to avoid feeling like you missed out--remember that sales are an advertising technique that makes money, not a store trying to be nice. Buying something you wouldn't otherwise doesn't save you any money, and gets you things you don't really want or need.</li>
			<li>Similarly, if something is a limited-time offer, think about whether you would want it if it wasn't.</li>
			<li>Go into a store knowing what you are looking for, and stick to that. You'll enjoy something you thought about and decided you wanted more than an impulse buy.</li>
			<li>Don't shop for fun. If you buy things for the satisfaction of buying them rather than an actual desire to use them, they'll go to waste. Pursue other things you are interested in instead.</li>
			<li>Look into brands rather than simply picking the one you've heard of before. Ads aren't aiming to make you drop everything and buy something right then--they often make money by getting you to remember their product's name and become familiar with it.</li>
			<li>Malls are designed to be distracting and make you lose track of time (how often do you see clocks in one?). Pick a store to go to or something to get, or set a time limit, or a spending limit. Keep in mind that the reason they feel like a comfortable environment is so you'll spend more money there.</li>
			<li>Limit buying new things, even more ethical or environmental ones, when you could use something you already have. For example, if you already have a reusable plastic bag, it takes less resources to just use it than to get a new, cloth bag.</li>
